Hello,

My name is Timothy Bollig and I work as a Systems Analyst at UPMC Health Plan.  I have knowledge of and experience in various tools and technologies such as SQL, Python, R, and Power BI.  I recently obtained a certificate in Data Analytics Technology from the Community College of Allegheny County and eventually plan to pursue a Master's degree in a data related field of study.  I am currently working on building my professional portfolio and further developing my industry knowledge through work experience and self study.

When I am not working on professional development I like to develop myself personally by spending my time reading, listening to podcasts, being active outside in nature, or partaking in my favorite activity, training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
